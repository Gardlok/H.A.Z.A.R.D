# H.A.Z.A.R.D
Collaborating a set of tools developed primarily by Rust 

Playing around with muxing different tools in order to create am IDE-like terminal environment. I am approaching this with a simple (until it's not) goal: By Rust, for Rust!

## Stack-ronym: 
- Helix 
- Alacrity
- Zellij
- Awesome
- Rust
- Development

## Expect:
Bootstrapping configs
Config backups, profiling, and syncing

## Don't expect:
To satisfy/accommodate  everyones' _requirements_
