# H.A.Z.A.R.D
Collaborating a set of tools developed primarily by Rust 

Playing around with muxing different tools in order to create am IDE-like terminal environment. I am approaching this with a simple (until it's not) goal: By Rust, for Rust!

## Stack-ronym: 
- Helix 
- Alacrity
- Zellij
- Awesome
- Rust
- Development

## Expect:
- Bootstrapping configs
- Profiles for varying user, environment, and/or project. Including Roaming, Local, and Ghost.  
- Config backups, profiling, and syncing
- Shortcut-key maps, command completions, and interactive guidance
- Built-in Documentation on the Rust ecosystem and packages for offline accessability and unified traversing
- Crates.io search pane with Cargo integration for effortless package management  

## Don't expect:
- To make everyone happy
